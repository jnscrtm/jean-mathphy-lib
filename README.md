# A Library Focused on Math and Physics
A quick disclaimer, this is not really a library per se, but is more appropriate to be called a *header* library. 
This remote repository does not have any form of fixed or planned updates whatsoever. The author has currently decided that he will commit and push an update whenever he feels like it.
This was originally meant to be a hobby project that the author will come back to from time to time, but was uploaded publicly instead under the reason of "who knows someone may draw inspiration from looking at this nonsense."
